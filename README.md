## Installation
### ðŸ“¦ Swift Package Manager
Add SwiftUIAlert as a Swift Package in Xcode 11.0 or later, `select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` and add the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/xxZap/SwiftUIAlert.git
```

## Requirements
- iOS 15+
- Swift 5

## Feature
Here's the list of the awesome features `SwiftUIAlert` has:
- [X] clean way to show single or multiple `Alert`s in SwiftUI
- [X] you don't have to add `Alert`s as view modifiers any more
- [X] blends in perfectly with all other SwiftUI functioanlity and principles
- [X] `Combine` friendly: just listen for changes and communicate them to the `AlertController`
- [X] `MVVM` friendly: handle alerts business logic directly from your viewModels and keep your views agnostic
- [ ] feedbacks

## The Problem

In `SwiftUI` alerts are added as view modifiers with a bit of help from `@State`:

``` swift
struct MyView: View {

    @State private var isSwiftUIAlert1Presented = false
    @State private var isSwiftUIAlert2Presented = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("SwiftUI Alert") {
            isSwiftUIAlert1Presented = true
        }
        .alert(isPresented: $isSwiftUIAlert1Presented) {
            Alert(title: Text("SwiftUI Alert 1"))
        }
        .alert(isPresented: $isSwiftUIAlert2Presented) {
            Alert(title: Text("SwiftUI Alert 2"))
        }
        ...
    }
}  
```

This will get ugly really quickly if you're trying to add multiple `Alert`s on a view. Lots of `@State`s with `Alert`s scattered all around your view ðŸ’©
